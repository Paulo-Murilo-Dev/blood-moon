# Blood Moon (work in progress)

[Blood Moon](https://www.blood-moon.dannyguo.com) is a [color scheme for code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).
I used [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark for several
years, but for fun, I decided to create a color scheme that exactly suits my
personal taste.

It is a work in progress, since I am changing colors and syntax rules as I use
the scheme myself.

## Principles
* Bold
    * I like **bold** colors.
* Dark
    * I prefer dark backgrounds for code,
      [even in bright environments](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes).
* Colorful
    * Some schemes only use a few colors or limit syntax highlighting to some elements.
    * With Blood Moon, code is filled with a wide variety of colors, to the point
      that some people will find it excessive and possibly distracting.
* Flexible
    * I tried using [Base 16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) and
      [Themer](https://themer.mjswensen.com/). I recommend them for ease of use,
      but I wanted very fine-grained control in how different syntax and UI
      elements are colored.

## Alternatives
Here are some alternatives that you might like better. You could also play
around with [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/).
