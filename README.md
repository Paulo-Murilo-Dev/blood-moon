Blood Moon is a [color scheme for code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).
I used [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark for several
years, but for fun, I decided to create a color scheme that exactly suits my
personal taste.

## Principles
* Bold
    * I like **bold** colors.
    * Some people [prefer low contrast](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax/issues/23)
      color schemes because it feels easier on their eyes, but I prefer
      high contrast text, even in dark environments.
* Dark
    * I prefer dark backgrounds for code,
      [even in bright environments](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes).
