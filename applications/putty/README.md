# Blood Moon for PuTTY

Installation:

Download `blood-moon.reg`, and open it. This will create a new saved session
in PuTTY with the colors applied.

To apply them to an existing session instead, edit the file, and replace
`Blood%20Moon` with your session's name. Use `%20` for spaces.

You can also manually apply the colors. Right click on the PuTTY title bar, and click `Change settings...`. Go
to `Window > Colours`, and fill in each color's RGB value (the three numbers
for each color in the file). The colors are in the same order in the file as
they appear in the settings menu. Keep in mind that the settings won't
persist unless you explicitly save them to a saved session in the `Session`
section.
